# Watson ?

Watson is basically Inbox by Gmail, but nicely packaged for your desktop with advanced fetures.


## Installation

Right now the only way to run Watson is to build from source. Packages for Windows, OS X and linux coming soon.

*Note: Watson requires that you have a working Installation of Nodejs on your system, and that it is on your PATH.*

```
$ git clone
$ cd Watson/
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
## TODO
- Cross Platform Packages
